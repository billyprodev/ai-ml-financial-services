Introduction to NLP and Chatbots Programming Assignment\n","\n","Welcome to our programming assignment on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Chatbots. This assignment is designed to provide you with practical experience in building and interacting with intelligent systems capable of understanding and responding to human language. As the world increasingly moves towards automation and artificial intelligence, the ability to create and utilize chatbots has become an invaluable skill in many fields, including customer service, data analysis, and even entertainment.\n","\n","In this assignment, you will embark on a journey to explore the fascinating world of NLP, a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. You will be using Python, a powerful and widely-used programming language, along with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, one of the most advanced NLP models available today. Your task will be to create a chatbot - a software application that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. This chatbot will simulate real-world scenarios, such as taking pizza orders, giving you firsthand experience in how these technologies are applied in practical situations.\n","\n","Throughout this assignment, you will learn to handle natural language data, interact with AI models, and create user interfaces for your chatbot. This will not only enhance your programming and data science skills but also give you insights into how conversational AI can be leveraged to solve real-world problems. Get ready to dive into the world of chatbots and NLP, where technology meets human language!\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"BoHh487V8l-B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step-by-Step Instructions\n","\n","1. **Open the Notebook in Google Colab:**  \n","   - If you have this notebook file locally, upload it to Google Drive, then open it with Google Colab.\n","   - If it's shared via a link, open the link and ensure you're running it in Colab.\n","\n","2. **Install Required Packages:**  \n","   - Run the first code cell (the one with `!pip install ...`) to install all required Python packages including `openai` and `ipywidgets`.\n","\n","3. **Set Your OpenAI API Key:**  \n","   - In the provided code, you will see a line `openai.api_key = \"your_API_token\"`.  \n","   - Replace `\"your_API_token\"` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n","\n","4. **Run the Code Cell for the Chat Interface:**  \n","   - After you set your API key, run the code cell that creates the chatbot interface.\n","   - Wait for the widgets (the text box and the \"Send\" button) to appear below the cell.\n","\n","5. **Start Chatting:**  \n","   - You’ll see a text input box and a \"Send\" button.\n","   - Type your message (for example, \"Hi\") in the text box and click **Send**.\n","   - The assistant’s response will be displayed below the box.\n","\n","6. **Continue the Conversation:**  \n","   - You can continue typing your questions or commands in the text box and hit **Send**.\n","   - The conversation’s context will be maintained, so feel free to ask follow-up questions or request additional details.\n","\n","7. **Troubleshooting:**  \n","   - If the widget does not appear, try re-running the cells.\n","   - Ensure that the notebook is connected to a runtime (check the top-right corner of Colab).\n","   - Check that the API key is correctly set and that your OpenAI account has available quota.\n","\n","8. **Enjoy the Interactive Experience:**  \n","   - Experiment with different prompts and observe how the assistant responds.\n","   - This setup simulates a conversational interface with an LLM model in a classroom

While OpenAI provides a free usage tier, exceeding these limits requires payment. **We recommend adding a small amount of money, such as 5 dollars, to your account to ensure uninterrupted access to the API during this assignment.** This precaution helps avoid any disruption due to potential overage beyond the free tier's usage limits.\n","\n","### Submission Requirements\n","Submit your work as a Python Jupyter notebook, Google Colab link, or a Python script (.py file). Ensure your code is accompanied by comprehensive comments that explain your implementation, the choices you made for the chatbot's context, and your findings regarding the chatbot's performance. Include:\n","- Code updated with your OpenAI API key, demonstrating that it executes without errors.\n","- A customized version of the example code, adapted to create a ChatGPT-powered chatbot for a business or organization of your choice. Let your imagination run wild—there are no limits!\n","- Detailed observations on the impact of adjusting the temperature parameter on the chatbot’s responses.\n","\n","### Grading Rubric (Total: 100 Points)\n","\n","#### Initial Setup and Execution (20 points)\n","- **API Key Configuration (10 points):** Correct integration of your OpenAI API key into the base code.\n","- **Successful Execution (10 points):** Running the initial code without any errors, ensuring a smooth start.\n","\n","#### Customization and Creativity (40 points)\n","- **Business/Organization Selection (10 points):** Originality in selecting and describing the business or organization. Anything goes—from a concert ticket chatbot to a virtual librarian!\n","- **Chatbot Customization (30 points):** Skillful customization of the chatbot, including adjustments to system messages, responses, and overall interaction flow tailored to your chosen context.\n","\n","#### Temperature Setting Exploration (20 points)\n","- **Temperature Testing (10 points):** Systematic experimentation with `different temperature settings to observe variations in chatbot behavior.\n","- **Analytical Commentary (10 points):** Thoughtful analysis of how temperature adjustments affect the chatbot's responses, including creativity, relevance, and coherence, supported by specific examples.\n","\n","#### Code Quality and Commentary (20 points)\n","- **Code Clarity and Organization (10 points):** Well-structured code with clear comments that elucidate the logic behind your implementation and any modifications made.\n","- **Insightful Documentation (10 points):** Thorough documentation of your chatbot's design process, functionality, and the observed impact of temperature on performance.\n","\n","### Notes for Students\n","- **API Key Confidentiality:** Treat your API key as confidential information. Do not include it in public submissions.\n","- **Billing Awareness:** Ensure you have a small balance (e.g., $5) in your OpenAI account to cover any usage beyond the free tier.\n","- **Creative Context Selection:** Embrace creativity in selecting a context for your chatbot. Consider unique, fun, or unconventional businesses or organizations.\n","- **Temperature Parameter Exploration:** A detailed exploration of the temperature parameter is crucial. Reflect on its role in shaping the user experience and the chatbot's utility.\n","\n","This assignment encourages you to blend technical programming skills with creative problem-solving.
